```
chmod +x srv
./srv
./server
```
If you compile and run the server and a blank line appears in the terminal, this means the server has started successfully.

Then, in the new terminal
```
chmod +x cli
./cli
./client
```
You'll see a that in the terminal after you compile and run the client. 
```
>
```

Now you can send any text to the server.

To exit the program on the client side
```
exit
```
